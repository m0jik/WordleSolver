### Requirements

- Java 21
    - <https://jdk.java.net/21/>
- Appropriate extensions/compilers installed on your IDE

### Quick Start

1. Ensure that Java 21 and some IDE with a terminal (I used VS Code but Eclipse could work, too) installed on your system.
2. Run the program.
3. From the `text` directory, open the `possibleWords.txt` file so that you may view possible words as you run the program.

    Check the notes below on how to properly use the program.
